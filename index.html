        <h1>Giving to charity makes you feel good </h1>
        <p>Donating to charity is a major mood-booster. The knowledge that you’re helping others is hugely empowering
            and,
            in turn, can make you feel happier and more fulfilled. Research has identified a link between making a
            donation to charity and increased activity in the area of the brain that registers pleasure
            – proving that as the old adage goes, it really is far better to give than to receive.</p>

        <p>Many people are concerned that their donations to charity may be reduced by tax or administrative costs,
            preventing the full amount from reaching the people or causes they really want to help.
            Thankfully there are ways to make the most of every donation to charity.</p>

                    <p>When you do charity, when you help someone who is really in need,
                        then that soul, on a physical level, feels a sigh of relief, and the sigh of relief from that
                        soul brings positive vibrations towards you.
                        These good deeds that you do bring you merit, which helps you go deep inside.
                        You should have certain merit in order to go into meditation also – not everybody can do it.
                        When you do some charity and good work, then so many souls, so many people, feel happy.
                        Their happiness comes to you as a blessing and that blessing helps you go deep in meditation.
